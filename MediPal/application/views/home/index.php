                                <p>Medipal helps you to answer questions that your healthcare provider (doctor/nurse/physiotherapist) requests. Your careprovider creates a Medipal Account for you and then determines which questions you should answer and on what occasions. Medipal will then remind you to answer the adequate questions at the right time.
                                    Your answers will be available for your healthcare provider and may be used as a basis for possible treatments.</p>
